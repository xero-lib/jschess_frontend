# JSChess Front-End
The JSChess front-end is a React app that communicates with the `jschess` program.

The React DnD library (and some JavaScript lag) causes the pieces to sometimes not move properly. You might have to try a few times to move a piece.

# How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/xero-lib/jschess_frontend --recursive --recurse-submodules
cd jschess_frontend
#if on windows, run the windows_setup.bat file
.\windows_setup.bat
#if on linux, run the linux_setup.sh file
chmod +x linux_setup.sh #if necessary 
./linux_setup.sh
```

This will launch a development server on `localhost:3000` that you can open and access in any modern browser.
