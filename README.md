# JSChess Front-End
The JSChess front-end is a React app that communicates with the `jschess` program.

The React DnD library (and some JavaScript lag) causes the pieces to sometimes not move properly. You might have to try a few times to move a piece.

# How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/xero-lib/jschess_frontend --recursive --recurse-submodules
cd jschess_frontend
npm i
npm start
```
